In this folder is stored the files that make meChat functionate. It is
important to leave these files in a subdirectory of the root of your web 
application.

EXAMPLES:
www/mechat -------------------------------- www.example.com/mechat
public_html/mechat ------------------------ www.example.com/mechat


IMPORTANT: Do not delete the file ".htaccess", because it protects the 
config file "config.json".
